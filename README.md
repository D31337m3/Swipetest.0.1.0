This code is designed to A) Test POS systems to see if their checksum 
and validation systems are functioning correctly, thus determining if they
pick out a fraudulent / spoofed / or otherwise erroneous card number. 

B) the code itself can also perform the checksum and validation checks within 
its own sandbox to validate card numbers being presented to POs systems and 
a double check when a POS systems checks have failed. 

Version 0.0.1
